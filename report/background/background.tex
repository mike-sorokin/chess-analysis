\chapter{Background}\label{backgroundChapter}

The motivation behind solving chess puzzles, especially under time pressure, is
to improve one's pattern recognition abilities. \citet{thoughtAndChoice} showed
that chess players do not have a square-by-square recollection of the chess
board during play. Instead, they rely on interactions, and potential
interactions of pieces in a more abstract sense. This is made strikingly clear
by a chess player's drawing of a position from memory, shown in Figure
\ref{deGrootFigure}.

\citet{thoughtAndChoice} writes, `the pieces themselves do not appear in the
drawing: rather the lines of force that go out from them'. This heuristic
allows expert human players to quickly hone in on the correct moves
\citep{bilalic2010mechanisms}, and significantly reduces their search space,
when compared to a naive brute-force search, which is the most common strategy
for chess engines. When analysing positions, even the most basic chess engines
are able to calculate the most accurate line (except some pathological cases),
but they are unable to draw similarities between different positions.

\end{figure}

In Figures \ref{chess1} and \ref{chess2}, 2 chess positions are shown,
featuring \emph{back-rank checkmates} -- one of the first tactical patterns
that a beginner might learn. A castled king is forced to stay on the back-rank
due to the configuration of his men, and an opposing heavy piece exploits this
weakness by delivering checkmate. It is already non-trivial to programmatically
identify this type of tactic, as a checkmate delivered to a king on the back
rank is not necessarily a \emph{back-rank checkmate}.

Given positions similar to ones like these, how does one draw similarities
between the abstract relations of the heavy piece, king, and vulnerable back
rank?

\section{Chess Notation}

For many decades, the standard for chess notation has been the Algebraic
System, where, generally speaking, moves are encoded by the piece abbreviation
(\texttt{Q} for queen, \texttt{K} for king, \texttt{N} for kNight) and a
reference to the destination square, which can be any letter \texttt{a-h} and
any number \texttt{1-8} \citep{fideNotation}. We assume that the reader is
familiar with the basic chess rules.

When storing chess games and positions in a computer-readable format was
required, many formats were proposed by various people, but Portable Game
Notation (PGN) and Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) stuck \citep{pgnNotation}.

\subsection{Portable Game Notation (PGN)}

PGN is a specific way to write chess moves in a text file. An example, taken
from Section 2.3 of the PGN Standard \citep{pgnNotation} is shown below. Along
with some metadata at the top of the file (player names, location, etc.\@), the
chess moves are written in algebraic notation, with an incrementing move
counter. In this example, Fischer played \texttt{e4} as his first move, with
Spassky responding with \texttt{e5}. The game ended in a draw on Spassky's 43rd
move.

\begin{verbatim}

[Event "F/S Return Match"]
[Site "Belgrade, Serbia JUG"]
[Date "1992.11.04"]
[Round "29"]
[White "Fischer, Robert J."]
[Black "Spassky, Boris V."]
[Result "1/2-1/2"]

1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. Bb5 a6 4. Ba4 Nf6 5. O-O Be7 6. Re1 b5 7. Bb3 d6 8. c3
O-O 9. h3 Nb8 10. d4 Nbd7 11. c4 c6 12. cxb5 axb5 13. Nc3 Bb7 14. Bg5 b4 15.
Nb1 h6 16. Bh4 c5 17. dxe5 Nxe4 18. Bxe7 Qxe7 19. exd6 Qf6 20. Nbd2 Nxd6 21.
Nc4 Nxc4 22. Bxc4 Nb6 23. Ne5 Rae8 24. Bxf7+ Rxf7 25. Nxf7 Rxe1+ 26. Qxe1 Kxf7
27. Qe3 Qg5 28. Qxg5 hxg5 29. b3 Ke6 30. a3 Kd6 31. axb4 cxb4 32. Ra5 Nd5 33.
f3 Bc8 34. Kf2 Bf5 35. Ra7 g6 36. Ra6+ Kc5 37. Ke1 Nf4 38. g3 Nxh3 39. Kd2 Kb5
40. Rd6 Kc5 41. Ra6 Nf2 42. g4 Bd3 43. Re6 1/2-1/2 

\end{verbatim}

The main advantages of PGN are the ease with which it can be read by a human
\citep{pgnNotation} and, given its consistent structure, the simplicity of
parsing it programmatically. This led PGN to become widely adopted and
recognised by almost all chess software. However, a downside of PGN is that it
is difficult to retrieve a position at a given move -- it must be recalculated
by tracing the moves of the game from the start.

\subsection{Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN)}

An alternative notation used for static chess positions is FEN. This is much
more compact than PGN, as no metadata about the game is stored other than the
state of the board. Below is an example FEN string for the board in Figure
\ref{chessKGA}.

\begin{verbatim}
rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq - 1 3
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \chessboard[setfen=rnbqkbnr/pppp1ppp/8/8/4Pp2/5N2/PPPP2PP/RNBQKB1R b KQkq -
    1 3]
    \caption{King's Gambit Accepted}
    \label{chessKGA}
\end{figure}

In FEN, pieces have their standard one-letter names, but pawns are explicitly
referred to with \texttt{P} or \texttt{p}. The number of consecutive empty
squares is denoted by an integer between \texttt{1} and \texttt{8}. The case of
the letter dictates what colour the chessman is: uppercase for white, and
lowercase for black. The arrangement of pieces is stored per rank,
left-to-right, with the first appearing rank in the string corresponding to
rank 8 on the board, and forward slashes delimiting the ranks. In the given
example, the 6th rank is stored as \texttt{8}, meaning there are 8 consecutive
empty squares on this rank. The 4th rank is stored as \texttt{4Pp2}, meaning
there are 4 empty squares, followed by a white pawn, then a black pawn, then 2
more empty squares.

The remaining characters store other information about the board. The single
\texttt{b} means it is Black to move; the string \texttt{KQkq} means White can
castle kingside (\texttt{K}) and queenside (\texttt{Q}), and Black can castle
both ways too (\texttt{kq}). If castling was not possible, this would be
denoted as \texttt{-}. The final 3 characters are en passant\footnote{French
for `in passing'. A special move where a pawn that advanced two squares can be
captured by an enemy pawn as if it was on the square behind. This is an
unending source of confusion for beginner players.} file, number of halfmoves
since the last pawn move or capture\footnote{Used for the fifty move draw
rule.}, and the number of full moves played.

\subsection{Bitboards}

When implementing chess programs on a computer, neither PGN or FEN are
applicable as they are difficult and slow to analyse. Instead, there are a
number of various numerical approaches to storing a chess position, with
bitboards being one of the bigger ones. One of the first mentions of Bitboards
was by \citet{bitboardsRussian}.

Described informally, a bitboard is a collection of 12 64-bit integers, where
each integer corresponds to a piece type and colour. The bits of that integer
encode the position of a piece on the board: a piece on \texttt{h1} activates
the 1st (least-significant) bit. Since modern processors utilise 64 bits, this
makes bitboards very fast -- especially when using other bitmaps to check for
piece attack maps and piece interactions. In fact, bitboards are used by
\citet{stockfishBitboard}, one of the strongest chess engines today.

\section{Examples of Chess Puzzle Themes}

In this section, we list a collection of common chess tactics which occur in
puzzles, and on a wider scale, games. Some of the positions are taken from
\citet{chesscomTactics}.

    \hspace{0.05\textwidth}
    \begin{minipage}{0.475\textwidth}
        \textbf{Mate In One}
        
        White wins in one move with \texttt{1.Qxh7\#}. There are many variants
        of simple checkmates, some of which are covered below.

    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{minipage}{0.475\textwidth}

    \hspace{0.05\textwidth}
    \begin{minipage}{0.475\textwidth}
        \textbf{Back-Rank Mate}
        
        Black wins with \texttt{1...Qxd1+ 2.Rxd1 Rxd1\#}. These positions occur
        very often when a king is castled, and the pawns surrounding the king
        on the 2nd/7th rank are preventing his escape to a different rank. A
        heavy piece\footnote{Rook or queen.} delivers the checkmate
        single-handedly.

    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \begin{minipage}{0.475\textwidth}
        \centering
        \chessboard[setfen=q2r3k/6pp/8/3Q2N1/8/8/5PPP/6K1 w - - 0 1]
    \end{minipage}
    \hspace{0.05\textwidth}
    \begin{minipage}{0.475\textwidth}
        \textbf{Smothered Mate}
        
        After \texttt{1.Nf7+ Kg8}, White delivers a \emph{double check} with
        \texttt{2.Nh6+}. Since Black is unable to remove both attacks on his
        king in one move, he is forced to move his king. \texttt{2...Kf8} leads
        to immediate mate with \texttt{3.Qf7\#}, so Black runs to the corner
        with \texttt{2...Kh8}. The white queen is sacrificed with
        \texttt{3.Qg8+ Rxg8}, entombing the black king in the corner. The white
        knight delivers checkmate with \texttt{4.Nf7\#}.

    \end{minipage}

    \begin{minipage}{0.475\textwidth}
        \textbf{Absolute and Relative Pins}
        
        In this position, Black's bishops are pinning White's knights on
        \texttt{c3} and \texttt{f3}. The white knight on \texttt{c3} is under
        an \emph{absolute pin} from the black bishop on \texttt{b4}, as moving
        it is illegal. The white knight on \texttt{f3} is under a
        \emph{relative pin} from the other black bishop on \texttt{g4}. Whilst
        moving this knight is legal, it is rarely done, as the bishop is then
        able to capture the white queen on \texttt{d1}.

    \end{minipage}

    \begin{minipage}{0.475\textwidth}
        \textbf{Fork}
        
        Forks come in multiple flavours, as multiple pieces are able to fork.
        Perhaps the most common is the knight fork, an example of which is
        possible on the board with \texttt{1.Ne7+}. The knight is attacking
        both the black rook on \texttt{c8} and black king on \texttt{g8}, and
        black is unable to capture the knight. After moving the king, black
        gives up the rook for a knight -- an unfavourable exchange.\\~\\The
        double pawn advance \text{1.b4} is also a fork. Black's knights are
        attacked and whilst they are able to defend each other, Black cannot
        move both to safety. One of them will be captured by the pawn.

    \begin{minipage}{0.475\textwidth}
        \textbf{Attack On \texttt{f2}/\texttt{f7}}

        The \texttt{f2} and \texttt{f7} squares are very vulnerable for White
        and Black, respectively. At the beginning of the game, these squares
        are defended only by the king. If neglected, a quick attack, or even a
        sacrifice, can be devastating.\\~\\In this position, after sacrificing
        the queen, White's bishop can capture the weak pawn on \texttt{f7},
        leading to \texttt{1.Bxf7+ Ke7 2.Nd5\#}.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Recognition of the \emph{Greek Gift Sacrifice} In Chess Games}

\citet{middleGamePatterns} report their findings on a program to identify the
\emph{Greek gift sacrifice} tactic in chess middlegames.\footnote{The phase of
the chess game where most pieces are developed and the kings are positioned
away from danger.} They found success, partly thanks to their detailed
representation of the board, where each square is represented by 71 binary
attribites \citep{middleGamePatterns} to encode the piece on the square and the
possible squares which are reachable by this piece. 

These attributes were also supplemented by 59 other binary attribites which
were devised by expert chess players, and represent the more complex, but still
quantifiable relationships \citep{middleGamePatterns}. These include open
files, control of vulnerable squares, piece activity, among others.

\citet{middleGamePatterns} achieved an 87.7\% classification performance on
detecting whether a position features a successful \emph{Greek gift sacrifice}
on relatively small (<200 positions) datasets. This work is promising, but more
investigation is needed given their analysis of only one pattern with a
decision tree algorithm. Also, their program still relied on predetermined
chess patterns, which introduces bias and might miss intricate similarities
between positions.

\subsection{A Novel Chess Board Representation For Convolutional Neural
Networks}\label{chessCNNSection}

\citet{chessCNN} explores the effectiveness of neural networks to analyse
whether a chess position is winning or losing, without creating specific
look-ahead algorithms. This is a very challenging task, but as part of the
analysis, the author proposed manually encoded features to a convolutional
neural network (CNN) to help identify strong patterns within the position. 

Some of these include an extra feature if the opponent is in check, specifying
the squares controlled by a piece exerting a pin on a different piece, centre
control, and vulnerable squares \citep{chessCNN}. These are well known
heuristics that are often taught to beginner-intermediate chess players, and
the author claims that these additional layers are `extremely representative of
the chess positions', and cause the CNN to outperform a naive, fully-connected
neural network.

This work is also a promising result, as it shows that these chess patterns,
albeit manually quantified, are valuable for an algorithm when analysing a
given chess position.

\subsection{A Computational Model for Estimating the Difficulty of Chess
Problems} \label{chessTreesOverview}

\citet{chessTrees} explore estimation of difficulty of chess problems in this
paper. By using a powerful chess engine, they generate a tentative move tree of
forcing or winning moves in a given position, mirroring the process of
calculating a variation for a chess player. 

By creating higher level metrics based off these trees (e.g. branching factor,
piece variety, move distances) and applying standard statistical machinery, the
authors are able to categorise the puzzles into various difficulty levels with
some success.

Their unique `meaningful search tree' \citep{chessTrees} approach to analysing
chess puzzle moves is novel, and we believe it has more potential for this
problem. Specifically, adding more chess-related metadata to the tree nodes (is
the move a fork, skewer, etc.?\@) could improve the performance and allow
better classification, and would be interesting to perform.

\subsection{Chess2vec: Learning Vector Representations for Chess}

In this paper, \citet{chess2vec} investigate and report on their results in
finding $d$-dimensional vector representations of the standard way to represent
a chess board in machine learning -- a bitboard, which is equivalent to a
$8\times8\times12$ binary tensor. 

With this naive approach, the authors make the observation that each chess
square is a 12-dimensional vector, which is independent of the board. By adding
a board hash, they segregate the pieces, making their vector representations
depend on the board state. With this method, \cite{chess2vec} claim to predict
$8.8\%$ of Stockfish moves correctly, which is an impressive statistic given no
chess logic or ruleset was explicitly implemented.

This is a promising result that suggests that vector representations of pieces
on a chess board can have unexpected performance, and it would be interesting
to build upon the authors' work.

\subsection{Automatic Recognition of Similar Chess Motifs}
\label{chessMotifsOverview}

In their thesis, \citet{chessMotifs} develop a method to retrieve similar chess
positions among a variety of tactically sharp examples. Building upon the naive
`static' similarity (piece locations, pawn structure, etc.\@), they implement
various `dynamic' similarity metrics (whether captures occur, attacks happen,
sacrifices happen, etc.\@ in the optimal move chain). It is well known
\citep{thoughtAndChoice, bilalic2010mechanisms} that chess players often think
about positions in this dynamic way. This is further reinforced by an example
given in the thesis, where a small static perturbation causes previously
dynamically similar positions to have nothing in common \citep{chessMotifs}.

This work is incredibly close to the goal of this project, and it has plenty of
interesting approaches and ideas. Importantly, their results are successful:
when a chess expert was asked to identify similar positions, they chose the
same ones that the program of \cite{chessMotifs} did. Whilst this is not a
faultless evaluation metric, it shows that there is potential within their
approach.

\section{Lichess Puzzle Database}\label{lichessPuzzlesSection}

Lichess (\url{https://lichess.org}) is a popular, open-source chess website
which often publishes the games that have been played by players of all skill
levels on it. As part of this, Lichess has published over 3.6 million rated and
tagged puzzle positions \citep{lichessPuzzles}. To generate these, 300 million
games were analysed with a powerful chess engine to find critical positions in
which a move must be played to capitalise on the opponent's mistake. These
puzzles were initially tagged to 60 manually created themes
\citep{lichessXML}, which were identified by a python implementation
\citep{lichessTagger}.

As various users of the site solved the puzzles, and manually highlighted the
themes that they thought occured in the puzzle, the ratings and tags of the
puzzle database evolved until their current state.

\subsection{Format}

These puzzles are stored in FEN format, with a reference to the game where they
appeared. They also contain the solution as a string moves, the tactics tags
\citep{lichessXML}, and the puzzle rating, along with other metadata.

An example puzzle string is shown below. This puzzle is also shown visually in
Figures \ref{puzzle1} and \ref{puzzle2}.

        \label{puzzle2}
    \end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Processing these is a trivial task with one small detail: the given FEN strings
are the state of the game right before the critical blunder is played by the
opposing site. This means the puzzle, as shown to the user, is the position
after the first move has been played. Fortunately, processing this data is made
simple with the python-chess library \citep{pythonChess}.

\subsection{Data Exploration}

The lichess puzzle database has approximately 3.8 million rated and tagged
chess puzzles. Initially, they were automatically processed
\citep{lichessTagger}, but were then refined with user feedback
\citep{lichessPuzzles}. This also allowed the puzzles to obtain a rating, which
is indicative of its difficulty \citep{lichessPuzzles}.

Overall, there are 60 various puzzle themes \citep{lichessXML}. Figure
\ref{dataThemeCounts} shows the counts of each theme in all of the contained
puzzles. It should be noted that some themes are mutually exclusive (a
checkmate puzzle cannot be both \emph{mate-in-one} and \emph{mate-in-two}).

The most common puzzle themes are the most general ones -- specifically
`short', `middlegame', and `endgame'. There is a lot of variation in how
frequent the various patterns are, which is a natural consequence of the game.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{project/img/puzzle_theme_counts.png}
    \caption{Frequency of puzzle themes in the lichess.org puzzle
    database.\cite{lichessPuzzles}}
    \label{dataThemeCounts}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{dataHistogram} shows the distribution of ratings across the chess
puzzles. It should be noted that these ratings are only appropriate within this
dataset, and cannot be compared to ratings of puzzles on other chess websites.
The puzzle ratings are quite symmetric about the mean, and this is of course a
result of the Glicko2 rating system, developed by \citet{glicko}.

When analysing the rating distribution by theme, an expected behaviour occurs.
Some chess tactics patterns are considerably simpler to spot, meaning a weaker
player is able to solve the puzzle with that theme. Therefore some puzzle
themes, \emph{back-rank mate}, for example, have lower-rated puzzles when
compared to puzzles featuring a \emph{trapped piece} or \emph{defensive
move}.\footnote{Notoriously difficult for humans, who are usually much better
at aggression than defense.\footnotemark}\footnotetext{In chess.}

Figures \ref{puzzle3} and \ref{puzzle4} show examples of some puzzles with
these themes.
