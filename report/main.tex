\renewcommand{\abstractname}{Acknowledgements}
\begin{abstract}

  I would like to thank my supervisor, Nicolas Wu, for his guidance, time, and
  laissez-faire approach, which helped me thrive and enjoy this project.

  I express my gratitude to my friends and family who helped and supported
  me during this project, and the rest of my studies. 

\end{abstract}

\renewcommand{\abstractname}{Ethical Discussion}
\begin{abstract}

  This project has few, if any, ethical considerations that need to be made.
  The biggest concern is the source of the large datasets that may be used in
  this project, namely, the Lichess puzzle database. However, this database,
  along with all Lichess games is released under the Creative Commons CC0
  license -- meaning there is no restriction in its use.

  Each puzzle in this database contains a link to the game from which it was
  extracted, and this contains a Lichess username, which is deanonymising. In
  the initial data processing stage, these links are going to be removed, as
  they are unnecessary for the goals of the project.

  Another concern is the use of, and reference to specific chess games and
  the players in them, and various chess compositions\footnote{An
  artificially created position to showcase a uniquely challenging, rare, or
  otherwise interesting theme.} with their authors. Other than proper
  reference to the creators of the game or composition, there are no other
  considerations to be made.
