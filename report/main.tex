\renewcommand{\abstractname}{Ethical Discussion}
\begin{abstract}

    This project has few, if any, ethical considerations that need to be made.
    The biggest concern is the source of the large datasets that may be used in
    this project, namely, the Lichess puzzle database. However, this database,
    along with all Lichess games is released under the Creative Commons CC0
    license -- meaning there is no restriction in its use.

    Each puzzle in this database contains a link to the game from which it was
    extracted, and this contains a Lichess username, which is deanonymising. In
    the initial data processing stage, these links are going to be removed, as
    they are unnecessary for the goals of the project.

    Another concern is the use of, and reference to specific chess games and
    the players in them, and various chess compositions\footnote{An
    artificially created position to showcase a uniquely challenging, rare, or
    otherwise interesting theme.} with their authors. Other than proper
    reference to the creators of the game or composition, there are no other
    considerations to be made.
